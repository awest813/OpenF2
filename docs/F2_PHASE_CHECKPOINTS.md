# Fallout 2 Critical Path Phase Checkpoints

This document defines pass/fail gates for each phase in the campaign-first completion plan.

---

## Phase 0 — Scope lock

- [x] Critical path regions listed and frozen
- [x] Required systems tags defined for each region
- [x] Non-goals explicitly frozen
- [x] Blocker matrix template active

Gate: **PASS** only when scope and tracking artifacts are in place.

---

## Phase 1 — Script VM de-stubbing

- [x] Procedure/opcode audit matrix created
- [x] Critical-path relevant partial/stub procedures prioritized
- [x] Implementations added for selected blockers
- [x] Regression test added for every de-stubbed behavior
- [ ] No known unresolved critical-path stub hit in targeted runs

Gate: **PASS** when scripted progression no longer hits known unresolved VM blockers on covered path.

---

## Phase 2 — Early campaign validation (Temple → Den)

- [x] Temple progression validated
- [x] Arroyo progression validated
- [x] Klamath progression validated
- [x] Den arrival/progression validated
- [x] Save/load continuity validated across this route

Gate: **PASS** when early-game path is repeatable without softlock/state corruption.

---

## Phase 3 — Dialogue/barter/interactions

- [x] Dialogue branch transitions stable
- [x] Barter transactions and pricing stable
- [x] Loot/inventory/panel lifecycle stability verified
- [x] Interaction regressions covered by automated tests

Gate: **PASS** when repeated interaction loops maintain consistent state.

---

## Phase 4 — World-map reliability

- [x] Travel state updates remain deterministic
- [x] Encounter transitions are atomic
- [x] Return-to-origin position/state verified
- [x] Repeated travel/encounter cycles remain stable

Gate: **PASS** when no world-map travel/encounter corruption remains on tested path.

---

## Phase 5 — Save/load hardening

- [x] Quest globals persist correctly
- [x] Map vars/area states persist correctly
- [x] Timers and world position persist correctly
- [x] Party/inventory continuity persists correctly
- [x] Long-session roundtrip tests pass

Gate: **PASS** when campaign-critical state survives save/load across phases.

---

## Phase 6 — Combat edge-case fidelity

- [x] AP/turn flow integrity verified
- [x] Critical effects tables and outcomes validated
- [x] Combat exits back to quest scripts cleanly
- [x] Quest-linked combat outcomes produce correct state

Gate: **PASS** when combat no longer causes critical-path divergence.

---

## Phase 7 — Quest consequences

- [ ] Reputation updates propagate correctly
- [ ] Karma updates propagate correctly
- [ ] Global/town vars gate dialogue/quests as expected
- [ ] Cross-region consequence checks validated

Gate: **PASS** when player consequences consistently alter campaign state as expected.

---

## Phase 8 — Cinematics/audio/endings

- [ ] Pre-ending trigger chain validated
- [ ] Ending sequence execution validated
- [ ] Slide ordering and fallback behavior validated
- [ ] Audio transitions validated

Gate: **PASS** when ending flow completes without runtime interruption.

---

## Phase 9 — Region-by-region certification

- [ ] Each region marked `CERTIFIED` in critical-path checklist
- [ ] No unresolved `CRITICAL` blockers in matrix
- [ ] Region-specific regression coverage in place

Gate: **PASS** when all listed critical regions are certified.

---

## Phase 10 — Full playthrough release gate

- [ ] One clean end-to-end campaign run reaches ending flow
- [ ] No unresolved campaign-critical blockers
- [ ] Regression suites covering new fixes are green

Gate: **PASS** when campaign completion is reproducible and test-backed.
